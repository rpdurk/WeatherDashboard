# Weather Dashboard

This is a simple weather app that lets you search for the current weather and a 5 day forecast.  The app will save your 4 recent searchers for quick future searches.  It is powered through jquery, css, html.

Using jquery, elements are dynamically rendered on the DOM.  This app features calling the same functions from multiple actions on different elements.

## Use

```
When traveling, commuting, or trying to actively get through, the weather can contribute to your success.  Prepare for any adventure by looking it up.
```

## Visual Walk Through

```
Start by going to the following link
   * https://rpdurk.github.io/WeatherDashboard/

When you arrive at the web page, you will see this screen.  Enter a city of your choice in.

Once you search a city the current weather and a 5 day forecast will be rendered.

### Author + Future Considerations

This App was written by Ryan Durk. 

There are still several places for improvement.

* Previous search buttons should be rendered immediately, not just on refresh.
* Date and times should be placed in a format that is more legible.
* Additional search metrics would be appreciated.
* Every weather app needs a surf report page as well.  Dawn Patrol Surf Report should be added for additional use.
